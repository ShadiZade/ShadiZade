# Dedication
My grandfathers were expelled from the land their ancestors ploughed for a millennium, all in service of Zionism, a racist, colonial, far-right ideology conceived in 19th century Europe by racist Europeans.  
All my efforts are **dedicated** to those men and women of Palestine who resisted the occupation, each in their own way:


## Faris Odeh (3 Dec 1985 — 8 Nov 2000, Age 14)

Born in Gaza in 1985, he was on the frontline of the Second Intifada when it erupted in Sep 2000. He played truant and even disobeyed his father in order to sneak away to the line of confrontation with the IDF, fearlessly throwing rocks at the soldiers and their heavy machinery.

10 days after this iconic image of him was taken, Faris Odeh was shot point-blank by an IDF soldier while throwing rocks at the Merkava-class tank. The IDF prevented medical services from reaching him for a whole hour, and he was pronounced dead on arrival. A week earlier, the IDF had shot and killed Faris's cousin Shadi Odeh. 

## Razan Najjar (13 Sep 1997 — 1 Jun 2018, Age 20)

A newly-graduated medic who volunteered for the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, Razan Najjar was engaged in treating the wounded protesters at the 2018 Great March of Return at the Gaza Siege Wall. While attending to her duties (clearly marked as a medic), she was shot [**intentionally**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/7/18/israeli-forces-deliberately-killed-palestinian-paramedic-razan) by an IDF sniper alongside several of her medical colleagues, some of whom sustained life-crippling injuries. Razan fell into a coma and was pronounced dead hours later.  

Disgustingly enough, the IDF's official social media accounts published a highly edited and grossly mistranslated video clip of Razan, allegedly stating to the camera that she was a "human shield", a favored piece of terminology in Israeli propaganda.


## Shireen Abu Akleh (3 Apr 1971 — 11 May 2022, Age 51)

Shireen served as Al-Jazeera's reporter in Palestine for over 2 decades, becoming a household name among several generation of Arabs. Her voice was synonymous with Al-Jazeera's reports on Palestinian events, and so it was a massive shock to millions of people when, while covering skirmishes in Jenin, she was shot and killed by an Israeli sniper in front of her own cameras. She wore a clearly marked **PRESS** vest that day, and the sniper continued to take potshots at her similarly-attired colleagues after 
shooting her.   

A devout Christian, Shireen's casket was displayed in Jenin and Ramallah where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians paid final respects, and was then taken to Jerusalem for church services and burial. However, Israel was not done with her, as they attacked her funeral and savagely beat her pallbearers in a now-notorious video, causing the casket to almost fall to the ground.

In an infuriatingly familiar manner, the IDF alleged that she was killed by Palestinian fire despite the fact that there were no Palestinian fighters in that area, and published several unrelated videos as "evidence". Several months and obstruction attempts later, Israel [admitted](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/05/middleeast/idf-shireen-abu-akleh-investigation-intl/index.html) to firing upon Shireen, but only well after the media attention died down. 


## Iyad Hallaq (1988 — 20 May 2020, Age 32)
![Iyad Hallaq](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Eyad_al-Hallaq_002.jpg/360px-Eyad_al-Hallaq_002.jpg)

Iyad was a severely autistic man living in occupied Quds (Jerusalem). He was on his way to a special education facility with his caretaker, when Israeli police started shouting at him, scaring him. He was confused and started to run, and despite his caretaker's attempts to explain his condition, he was summarily executed, 7 bullets entering his body from 3 M-16 rifles firing simultaneously. As usual, Israeli media attempted to portray him as a "dangerous terrorist" reaching for a gun, but then backed down when independent investigation showed that he had no weapons on his person. No one has been punished or even reprimanded for this crime.
