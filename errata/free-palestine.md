My efforts are **dedicated** to those men and women of Palestine who resisted the occupation, each in their own way:

Born in Gaza in 1985, he was on the frontline of the Second Intifada when it erupted in Sep 2000. He played truant and even disobeyed his father in order to sneak away to the line of confrontation with the IDF, fearlessly throwing rocks at the soldiers and their heavy machinery.
