# Dedication
My grandfathers were expelled from the land their ancestors ploughed for a millenium, all in service of Zionism, a colonial, far-right ideology conceived in 18th century Europe by racist Europeans.
My efforts are **dedicated** to those men and women of Palestine who resisted the occupation, each in their own way:


# Faris Odeh (3 Dec 1985 â€” 8 Nov 2000, Age 14)

Born in Gaza in 1985, he was on the frontline of the Second Intifada when it erupted in Sep 2000. He played truant and even disobeyed his father in order to sneak away to the line of confrontation with the IDF, fearlessly throwing rocks at the soldiers and their heavy machinery.

10 days after this iconic image was taken, Faris Odeh was shot point-blank by an IDF soldier while throwing rocks at the Merkava-class tank. The IDF prevented medical services from reaching him for a whole hour, and he was pronounced dead on arrival. A week earlier, the IDF had shot and killed Faris's cousin Shadi Odeh.
