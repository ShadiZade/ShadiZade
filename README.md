# Free Culture
Free Culture: The full demonetization and reclamation of cultural heritage from the hands of philistine capitalist profiteers to the hands of the common people.

## Why Free Culture?
Because:
- Despite classist obfuscation, the common people are more capable of art appreciation than the average profit- and prestige-centric bourgeois "patron".
- Valuable cultural heritage rots to dust and gets forgotten behind the walls of copyright.
- The rich have no inherent right to have more access to the products of culture compared to the poor. 
- As a rule, art is tainted by profit motive. The artist must be free to create without the burden of "marketability". Here's what [George Lucas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWqvaMEFIdI) and [Georg Lukacs](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/1934/expressionism.htm) has to say about it.
